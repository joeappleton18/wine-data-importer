# Wine Data Importer 

A very, very simple application to assist students in importing a wine tasting data set that we are working with in a second year database unit.

## Getting Started 
- Ensure you have a local Mongo database running on port `27017`. If you are using different connection parameters then update the connection string, found in line 5 of the index.js file
- Clone this repo - `git clone https://github.com/joeappleton18/wine-data-importer`
- Point a command line shell to the resulting `wine-data-importer-folder`
- Install the dependencies - `npm install`
- Run the program - `npm run seed`
